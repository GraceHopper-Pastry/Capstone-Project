# **Stack Support**

Welcome to Stack Support! Stack Support was created by four brand-new software engineers who had a lot of questions. How do you decide between Front-End, Back-End, and Full-Stack career paths? What really matters on a resume for tech jobs? Should I be working on a back-end language like Ruby, GO or Python? Or should I just keep working to get better and better at Javascript? Wouldn't it be great if there was someplace we could connect to more experienced developers and get some answers? Thus, Stack Support was born.
